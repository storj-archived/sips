Abstract
--------

This document describes hierarchically deterministic node IDs for the purposes of running a cluster of renter nodes that can all share the same contracts with farmers.

The specification extends bitcoin ECDSA derivation standard BIP32 and BIP43, and extends both contacts and contracts with new fields and message and contract verification.

Motivation
----------

To more evenly distribute shards in the network when running a cluster of renter nodes. By using a hierarchically determined key, contracts can reference the `renter_hd_key` such that a renter node can use a derived key `renter_hd_index` and act an behalf of the `renter_hd_key`. The `nodeID` will use the derived key for more evenly distributed Kademlia routing.

Specification
-------------

### Key Derivation

Key derivation must match the specification of Bitcoin Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP32) with the purpose field described in Bitcoin Purpose Field for Deterministic Wallets (BIP43).

We define the following levels in BIP32 path:

```
m / purpose' / group_index' / node_index
```

Apostrophe in the path indicates that BIP32 hardened derivation is used.

#### Purpose

Purpose is a constant set to 3000, so as to not collide with any bitcoin related proposals which recommends to use the BIP number.

```
m / 3000' / group_index' / node_index
```

#### Group Index

The `group_index` for most purposes will be 0. However is reserved for a future use to be able to increment in the case that the contracts should be updated with a new key.

#### Node Index

The `node_index` can be a number from 0 through 2 ^ 31 - 1, so that it's using a non-hardened paths and it's always possible to derive the public key for a node using the `m / 3000' / group_index'` derived extended public key. This gives a total of 2.147 billion possible nodes to run in a group cluster.

---

**Security Note**: As noted in BIP32, a compromised private key at the `node_index` level in combination with the extended public key at the `group_index` level will compromise all descending private keys derived from the `group_index` level, this is the rationale for a hardened path for the `group_index`.

---

### Message Format and Authentication

This specification extends the message format for a contact to include `hdKey` and `hdIndex`.

```json
{
  "contact": {
    "address": "10.0.0.2",
    "port": 1337,
    "nodeID": "89cc3ddb4209c6e7e301c10c0257adf4fd85f253",
    "hdKey": "xpub...",
    "hdIndex": 12,
    "protocol": "0.7.2"
  }
}
```

The `hdKey` is the extended public key derived from `m / 3000' / group_index'` and uses the same serialization format described in BIP32, and as recommended in BIP43, a base58 encoded string.

If the `hdKey` is present, nodes must validate that a message is signed by the key derived from the `hdKey` at the index `hdIndex`, and that the hash160 *(sha256 and ripemd160)* of that derived public key matches the `nodeID`.

### Contracts

Two new fields are added to a contract `renter_hd_key` and `renter_hd_index`. The serialization will be identical to the serialization for the contacts.

A contract with a `renter_hd_key` can be authenticated for any contact that has a matching `hdKey` and with any `hdIndex`. The contract itself must be signed by the corresponding `renter_hd_key` and `renter_hd_index`. The contract `renter_id` is the sha256 and then ripemd hash of the serialized public key of the derived key, and this renter will receive the offer for the contract from the farmer, while any of the sibling renters should be able to act on behalf of the contract.

Backwards Compatibility
----------------------

Because there are new fields being added to both contact and contract, new renters will require that farmers have also been upgraded to use the functionality.
